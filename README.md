# AM USING PYTHON
Aim

To implement and analyze amplitude modulation (AM) using Python's NumPy and Matplotlib libraries. Apparatus Required
Software: Python with NumPy and Matplotlib libraries

Apparatus:

Hardware: Personal Computer

Theory

Amplitude Modulation (AM) is a technique used in electronic communication, primarily for transmitting information via a radio carrier wave. In AM, the amplitude of the carrier wave is varied in proportion to that of the message signal. The general form of an AM signal is:

Algorithm:

1.Initialize Parameters: Set the values for carrier frequency, message frequency, and sampling frequency.
2.Generate Time Axis: Create a time vector for the signal duration.
3.Generate Message Signal: Define the message signal as a cosine wave.
4.Generate Carrier Signal: Define the carrier signal as a cosine wave.
5.Modulate Signal: Apply the AM formula to obtain the modulated signal.
6.Plot the Signals: Use Matplotlib to plot the message signal, carrier signal, and modulated signal.

Procedure:

• Refer Algorithms and write code for the experiment. 
• Open SCILAB in System • Type your code in New Editor 
• Save the file • Execute the code
• If any Error, correct it in code and execute again Verify the generated waveform using Tabulation and Model Waveform

OUTPUT WAVEFORM:

Result:


The message signal, carrier signal, and amplitude modulated (AM) signal will be displayed in separate plots. Thus AM is implemented using numPy and Matplotlib.
